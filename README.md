Notebooks created in Google Colab.

These notebooks serve as exercises in implementing neural networks in PyTorch and in preprocessing time series data for use with these neural networks. The goal here is to practice implementation and data preprocessing rather than to achieve any "state-of-the-art" results, hence, extensive diagnostics are not given in much depth here.
